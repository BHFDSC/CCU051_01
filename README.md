# Under-vaccination and severe COVID-19 outcomes: meta-analysis of national cohort studies of over 64 million people in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales

## Project description

Receiving fewer than the recommended number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines doses (under-vaccination) may be associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. We sought to determine the factors associated with under-vaccination, and the risk of hospitalisation or death after COVID-19 in people who were under-vaccinated in each of the UK nations, and across the UK population.
